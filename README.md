Starliners (Galactic Empire Implosion Simulator)
================================================

### What is it?

Starliners is a small TD-like game set in space. Your goal is to survive as long as possible and take as many invaders with you as possible.

### Status

The game is about 90 % done, but as usual the last 10 % will take 90 % of the time to complete.

### Building

Building should be possible with both VisualStudio 2013 and Xamarin Studio 2013. .NET 4.5 or Mono 3.6.0 or later are required to build the game.

Dependencies:

- OpenTK 1.1
- OpenAL
- DragonOgg
- QuickFont (https://github.com/SirSengir/QuickFont)

### Binaries

The launcher is available from http://beesntrees.net/site.starliners/download/ and will keep the game updated to the latest available Jenkins build.

### Notes

Beware of ugly code.

Bugfixes are generally welcome. If you want to contribute something which changes game mechanics, please talk to someone with commit privileges first. Nothing is more frustrating than putting a lot of work and effort into a new game mechanic and then having the PR rejected because it doesnâ€™t fit gameplay-wise.

**If you submit a PR you must accept the [Contributor License Agreement](https://www.clahub.com/agreements/SirSengir/Starliners). There is no way around that, since otherwise changing the license later - even to something more permissive! - , becomes close to impossible.**
